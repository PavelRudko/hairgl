# hairgl
OpenGL implementation of realtime hair simulation and rendering.

Inspired by NVIDIA HairWorks and AMD TressFX.
Rendering multiple strands is implemented using tesselation and geometry shaders.
Simulation is implemented using compute shaders.
I used multiple articles and resources as references, but the most useful was this one:
[HairCourse](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2010/SIGGRAPH/HairCourse_SIGGRAPH2010.pdf).
